# Markov Chains

## Introduction

Markov chains are powerful mathematical models for representing sequential processes, where the probability of each event only depends on the state of the previous event, not the entire history. This memoryless property makes them invaluable in various fields for modeling dynamic systems.

## Key Concepts

### States

States represent the possible conditions or outcomes of the system.

### Transitions

Transitions are the movements between states, defining the progression of the system.

### Memoryless Property

Markov chains exhibit a memoryless property, where future states depend solely on the immediate previous state.

## Transition Matrix

### Overview

The transition matrix is a crucial tool for understanding and analyzing Markov chains.

### Structure

- It is a square matrix where rows and columns correspond to states in the model.
  
- Matrix elements (`P(i, j)`) denote the probability of transitioning from state i to state j in one step.

### Properties

- All probabilities range between 0 and 1.
  
- Row sums equal 1, ensuring the system transitions to some state in the next step.

## Computation

### Matrix Construction

- Transition matrices are often computed by observing the system's behavior and counting state transitions.

### Probability Estimation

- The observed counts are used to estimate transition probabilities.

## Applications

Markov chains find applications across diverse domains:

- **Natural Language Processing:** Modeling language sequences.
  
- **Genetics:** Analyzing DNA sequences.
  
- **Finance:** Predicting market trends.
  
- **Customer Behavior Modeling:** Understanding user interactions.
  
- **Weather Forecasting:** Predicting weather patterns.
  
- **Recommendation Systems:** Predicting user preferences.

## Overview
In this analysis, we employed 12-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) data for the Indian region. The SPEI values were categorized into distinct states, providing a discretized representation. Subsequently, we computed the transition frequency to understand how the system moves between these states over time. Using the observed frequencies, we then calculated transition probabilities, representing the likelihood of moving from one SPEI state to another in a single time step. Notably, these transition probabilities were stored for each pixel, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the probabilistic behavior of SPEI data across the entire Indian region.
